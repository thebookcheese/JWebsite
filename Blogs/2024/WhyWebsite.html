    <h1> Why I Made This Website</h1>
    I made this webstite because my friend made one (<a href="https://wilburwilliams.uk/">Wilbur's</a> and we had already collaborated on <a href="https://wilburwilliams.uk/HTML2/"> HTML2</a>). It has since become a thing where I make silly, fun or other things, and I (as of 5/7/24) don't know what to add. I might add bootstrap or work on js padms.
    Anyway, now you know why I made this website.
