        <h3> Location </h3>
        Tropical Rainforests are found near the equator (between 15* North and South or between the Tropics) where the sunlight is more concentrated. This heats the moist air causing it to rise and form clouds which causes the wet and humid weather associated with tropical rainforests

          <li>          
            <h4>Emergents</h4>
            Emergents are trees (e.g kapoks) who out-compete others by growing extremely quickly to reach the canopy (and sunlight) to photosynthisise.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4> Large Leaves</h4>
            Many plants in tropical rainforests will have very large leaves compared to their size which maximises the amount of sunlight the plant can absorb for photosynthisis (because of the dark, competitive enviroment of a rainforest)
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Drip tips and waxy leaves</h4>
            Drip tips are a pointy end to a leaf that allows water to drip quickly off the leaf and stop it burning in the intense heat.
            A waxy surface area helps stop the leaf rotting in the hot and wet conditions.
